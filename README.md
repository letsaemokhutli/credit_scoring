## Credit score band predicting model

##### The objective of undertaking this project exercising my data science skills, learning to use Crisp-DM, and building a credit score band predicting model that can be used in credit providing businesses. With the knowledge of potential credit score band of a customer we can determine if they will be able to repay their credit hence being able to decide on not give credit to those customers in a low credit score band. While taking the project we would want to answer the following questions :

### a) Given attributes, in which credit score band does the customer belong?

##### b) Which credit score band has more EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) for all month(Jan to Aug)?

##### c) Which age group shows to have good credit score and what's their outstanding debt range?

##### d) Given credit history age, what's the EMI in each credit score band?
